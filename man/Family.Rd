\details{
  The boosting algorithm implemented in \code{\link{mboost}} minimizes the
  (weighted) empirical risk function \code{risk(y, f, w)} with respect to \code{f}.
  By default, the risk function is the weighted sum of the loss function \code{loss(y, f)}
  but can be chosen arbitrarily. The \code{ngradient(y, f)} function is the negative
  gradient of \code{loss(y, f)} with respect to \code{f}.

  Pre-fabricated functions for the most commonly used loss functions are
  available as well. Buehlmann and Hothorn (2007) give a detailed
  overview of the available loss functions. The \code{offset} function
  returns the population minimisers evaluated at the response, i.e.,
  \eqn{1/2 \log(p / (1 - p))} for \code{Binomial()} or \code{AdaExp()}
  and \eqn{(\sum w_i)^{-1} \sum w_i y_i} for \code{Gaussian()} and the
  median for \code{Huber()} and \code{Laplace()}. A short summary of the
  available families is given in the following paragraphs:

  \code{AdaExp()} and \code{Binomial()} implement
  families for binary classification. \code{AdaExp()} uses the
  exponential loss, which essentially leads to the AdaBoost algorithm
  of Freund and Schapire (1996). \code{Binomial()} implements the
  negative binomial log-likelihood of a logistic regression model
  as loss function. Thus, using \code{Binomial} family closely corresponds
  to fitting a logistic model.
  However, the coefficients resulting from boosting with family
  \code{Binomial} are \eqn{1/2} of the coefficients of a logit model
  obtained via \code{\link{glm}}. This is due to the internal recoding
  of the response to \eqn{-1} and \eqn{+1} (see below).
  However, Buehlmann and Hothorn (2007) argue that the
  family \code{Binomial} is the preferred choice for binary
  classification. For binary classification problems the response
  \code{y} has to be a \code{factor}. Internally \code{y} is re-coded
  to \eqn{-1} and \eqn{+1} (Buehlmann and Hothorn 2007).

  \code{Gaussian()} is the default family in \code{\link{mboost}}. It
  implements \eqn{L_2}Boosting for continuous response. Note
  that families \code{GaussReg()} and \code{GaussClass()} (for regression
  and classification) are deprecated now.
  \code{Huber()} implements a robust version for boosting with
  continuous response, where the Huber-loss is used. \code{Laplace()}
  implements another strategy for continuous outcomes and uses the
  \eqn{L_1}-loss instead of the \eqn{L_2}-loss as used by
  \code{Gaussian()}.

  \code{Poisson()} implements a family for fitting count data with
  boosting methods. The implemented loss function is the negative
  Poisson log-likelihood. Note that the natural link function
  \eqn{\log(\mu) = \eta} is assumed. The default step-site \code{nu = 0.1}
  is probably too large for this family (leading to
  infinite residuals) and smaller values are more appropriate.

  \code{CoxPH()} implements the negative partial log-likelihood for Cox
  models. Hence, survival models can be boosted using this family.

  \code{QuantReg()} implements boosting for quantile regression, which is
  introduced in Fenske et al. (2009). \code{ExpectReg} works in analogy,
  only for expectiles, which were introduced to regression by Newey and Powell (1987).

  Families with an additional scale parameter can be used for fitting
  models as well: \code{PropOdds()} leads to proportional odds models
  for ordinal outcome variables. When using this family, an ordered set of
  threshold parameters is re-estimated in each boosting iteration.
  \code{NBinomial()} leads to regression models with a negative binomial
  conditional distribution of the response. \code{Weibull()}, \code{Loglog()},
  and \code{Lognormal()} implement the negative log-likelihood functions
  of accelerated failure time models with Weibull, log-logistic, and
  lognormal distributed outcomes, respectively. Hence, parametric survival
  models can be boosted using these families. For details see Schmid and
  Hothorn (2008) and Schmid et al. (2010).
