\title{ Prediction of Body Fat by Skinfold Thickness, Circumferences, and 
        Bone Breadths}
\description{
    For 71 healthy female subjects, body fat measurements and several
    anthropometric measurements are available for predictive modelling
    of body fat.
}

\details{
 
  Garcia et al. (2005) report on the development of predictive regression equations
  for body fat content by means of common anthropometric
  measurements which were obtained for 71 healthy German women.
  In addition, the women's body composition was measured by
  Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). This reference method
  is very accurate in measuring body fat but finds little applicability
  in practical environments, mainly because of high costs and the
  methodological efforts needed. Therefore, a simple regression equation
  for predicting DXA measurements of body fat is of special interest for the practitioner.
  Backward-elimination was applied to select
  important variables from the available anthropometrical measurements and
  Garcia (2005) report a final linear model utilizing
  hip circumference, knee breadth and a compound covariate which is defined as
  the sum of log chin skinfold, log triceps skinfold and log subscapular skinfold.
