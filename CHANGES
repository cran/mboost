  o  add checks for CoxPH (against coefficients and logLik of coxph)

  o  add weights to CoxPH

  o  the ngradient function in Family objects needs to implement
     arguments (y, f, w), not just (y, f)

  o  check for meaningful class of the response for some families


		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.4-9 (2006-07-17)

  o  some small speed improvements in `gamboost'

  o  use NROW / NCOL more often (now that `y' may be a `Surv' object)

  o  implement `cvrisk', a general cross-validation function for the
     empirical risk and a corresponding plot method

  o  unify risk computations in all three fitting functions

  o  unify names for `gb' objects

  o  allow for out-of-bag risk computations

  o  some cosmetics

  o  update keywords in Rd-files

  o  risk was always 0 in Huber()@risk when d was choosen adaptively
