  o  predict(..., newdata) can take a matrix now


		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.4-12 (2006-09-13)

  o  predict(<blackboost-object>, type = "response") did not return
     factors when the response was actually a factor

  o  report offset in print methods

  o  add offset attribute to coef.glmboost


		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.4-11 (2006-09-07)

  o  add `contrasts.arg' argument to `glmboost.formula'

  o  more meaningful default for `grid' in `cvrisk'

  o  add checks for CoxPH (against coefficients and logLik of coxph)

  o  add weights to CoxPH

  o  the ngradient function in Family objects needs to implement
     arguments (y, f, w), not just (y, f)

  o  check for meaningful class of the response for some families


		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.4-9 (2006-07-17)

  o  some small speed improvements in `gamboost'

  o  handle factors in `gamboost' properly (via a linear model)

  o  update and improve entries in DESCRIPTION

  o  documentation updates


		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.4-8 (2006-06-05)

  o  Huber() is `Huber Error', not `Huber Absolute Error'

  o  added `CoxPH' family object for fitting Cox models

  o  remove inst/LaTeX

  o  use NROW / NCOL more often (now that `y' may be a `Surv' object)

  o  implement `cvrisk', a general cross-validation function for the
     empirical risk and a corresponding plot method

  o  unify risk computations in all three fitting functions

  o  unify names for `gb' objects

  o  allow for out-of-bag risk computations

  o  some cosmetics

  o  update keywords in Rd-files

  o  risk was always 0 in Huber()@risk when d was choosen adaptively

  o  pData(westbc)$nodal.y has levels `negative' and `positive' 
     (lymph node status)


		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.4-7 (2006-06-19)

  o  add src/Makevars (required for Windows builds)

  o  make sure objects that are modified at C-level get _copied_ in
     `blackboost'


		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.4-6 (2006-06-14)

  o  some minor `codetools' fixes: removed unused variables 
     and an out-dated function

  o  add `codetools' checks to regression tests

  o  fix xlab in plot.gbAIC
